# Starbucks Capstone Challenge

## Introduction

Starbucks has provided a dataset that emulates the behavior of
customers using the Starbucks rewards mobile app. The Starbucks app
provides a way to adverstise and share offers with the
customers. Customers can also use it to pay at the stores. Starbucks
sends different types of advertisement and offers once every few days to their
customers. A customer might get one of the following:

- Informational offer (i.e., mere advertisement)
- Discount offer
- Buy one get one free (BOGO) offer

Discount and BOGO offers have a challenge, that is, the customer must
make a minimum purchase before it can redeem the offer. Additionally,
each offer has an expiration date. In the case of the informational
offers, the expiration date is when the customer stop feeling the
influence of the advertisement.

The offers are not distributed at the same time to all users, and each
offer has a different value. The goal of the project is to use the
simulated data to determine the demographics of the groups that
respond best to each offer type. Specifically, the data provided
includes the demographics of each customer, the app activity of
customers for a period of 30 days. It includes the timestamps of when
a custumer received, viewed and completed an offer, when a purchase
was done, and the amount of money spent.
